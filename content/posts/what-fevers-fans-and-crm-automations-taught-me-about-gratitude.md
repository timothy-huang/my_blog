Hello friends! And a warm welcome to those who found me through my LinkedIn post [announcing my adult gap year](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timhuangg_one-month-ago-i-did-something-a-little-scaryi-activity-7318974553328599040-JBRH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABtCX5wBlgNzGCanfVpJqb6UIAFE1UNhaNY&_bhlid=c35353abb2a9991a4e39bbdb41e2dae1007beb96).

If you‚Äôre new here‚ÄîI‚Äôm Tim. I left behind my 9-5 as a product manager to travel across Asia and explore what‚Äôs next. This newsletter is basically my public diary. Expect travel tales, personal finance musings, experiments with new tools, and conversations with creators and entrepreneurs.

This week, I‚Äôm writing from **Siargao**, also known as the surfing capital of the Philippines.

# ü§í Food poisoning AGAIN

A few days ago I caught a stomach bug that knocked me out. I was feverish and sweaty, and somehow I ended up in the *one room* in our hostel without AC‚Äîdubbed ‚Äúthe fan room‚Äù.

While lying there, I found myself journaling about how I missed my cushy life in the Bay Area. Things like:

-

Temperate weather

-

A well-stocked kitchen

-

Not fearing for my life crossing the street

In the midst of my feverish journaling frenzy, I thought back to a recent quote I read:

**Focus on the things you are for, not the things you are against.**

Many people spend large chunks of their day thinking about what they hate. They are always telling you about something they dislike: this food, that subject, this political party, that coworker.

You are more than your frustrations. Build your identity around what you love.

  From James Clear‚Äôs 3-2-1 newsletter

So I gave it a shot. I wrote down what I *was* grateful for:

-

A roof over my head

-

A bed to sleep in

-

Electric fans to cool me down

-

The opportunity to connect with people from all corners of life

Naturally, two hours later the power went out in the middle of a tropical downpour.

But somehow, I still felt okay. It seems like focusing on the positives, rather than the negatives, made me more resilient against the challenges I was experiencing.

The next day, I bounced back.

Suddenly, everything was amazing again‚Äîfrom impromptu chats with travelers to discovering a hidden gem cafe at the end of a dirt road. It‚Äôs wild how health flips your whole world.

# üèÑ‚ôÇÔ∏è The Siargao Curse

I was talking to a few Filipino travelers when I learned about **The Siargao Curse**: once you visit Siargao, you have to come back.

My new friend Rey visited Siargao 5 times in the past year, staying for weeks at a time. I have to say, now that I‚Äôm in good health, I see the appeal.

On another note, I love seeing Filipinos exploring different parts of their own country. It seems to do a better job of keeping the culture alive, compared to places that cater only to Western tastes. And selfishly, I tend to get better, more authentic recs from Filipino tourists üòé

# üß† Boredom and business

Since I started traveling full time, I‚Äôve found myself with a lot of empty, unstructured time. Eventually, I hit the elusive state of feeling *bored*.

Which is why when my brother asked me to help out with his small business, I was eager to jump in.

This week, I‚Äôm helping him:

-

Redesign his CRM in **Airtable**

-

Automate his client intake and onboarding process with **Make** And it‚Äôs* fun*.

Making systems run more efficiently really scratches my optimization brain. I know, I know, I‚Äôm a nerd üòÇ

And in the spirit of gratitude, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm interested in things that happen to be valuable for businesses, so work can be engaging instead of a chore.

# What‚Äôs next?

I‚Äôll be leaving for Singapore next week, where I‚Äôm planning to meet up with a few folks in the local tech / media scene.

If you have any recs for the city, let me know!

Until next time,
Tim

**P.S.** Have you ever bounced back from a terrible experience, only to feel more grateful afterward? Hit reply‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to feature some guest stories in the future!

*[From Third World to First: The Singapore Story](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144409.From_Third_World_to_First?utm_source=timhuang.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=what-fevers-fans-and-crm-automations-taught-me-about-gratitude&_bhlid=9ed79a5bd9120d802e6d8dd70eda7bce9c1d43dd)***[ ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144409.From_Third_World_to_First?utm_source=timhuang.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=what-fevers-fans-and-crm-automations-taught-me-about-gratitude&_bhlid=84222553708948d1578ce149323e5161744e5569)****by Lee Kuan Yew**- Can I just say it‚Äôs crazy that we can read the first-hand account of how someone built a modern nation? There‚Äôs a lot to admire about Singapore‚Äôs development story as well as its policies around housing, retirement, and car ownership. This book is a fascinating look into how Singapore transitioned into independence, and the big bets that Lee Kuan Yew made to turn the city-state into a global powerhouse.

-

I have to admit that from my experience as a PM, I‚Äôm very sympathetic to the idea of designing systems that work without relying on individual choice (or unnecessarily complex knowledge of tax codes).

-

Example: **Retirement systems**

-

In the US, retirement is supported by Social Security, which is dependent on taxes paid by younger generations and [may become insolvent by 2033](https://budget.house.gov/press-release/social-security-and-medicare-continue-on-path-to-insolvency-trustees-confirm?utm_source=timhuang.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=what-fevers-fans-and-crm-automations-taught-me-about-gratitude&_bhlid=196988bb4e65532a81388cc56126df42dcd047d4). Whatever‚Äôs not covered by Social Security is supposed to come from your own savings in a mish-mash of tax-advantaged retirement accounts, which many people don‚Äôt understand fully or contribute to. This leads many to be fully reliant on Social Security in retirement.

-

In contrast, Singapore *mandates* employers and employees to contribute 20%+ of the employee‚Äôs income towards a centrally managed pension fund that guarantees income at retirement. This makes the system self-sustaining, without passing the burden on to future generations. That said, adopting a centralized system like Singapore‚Äôs requires an extremely low level of corruption and transparent governance, which is‚Ä¶ optimistic in many parts of the world.

*[**Crime and Punishment**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment?utm_source=timhuang.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=what-fevers-fans-and-crm-automations-taught-me-about-gratitude&_bhlid=cc3f7d9d8555bee228147fa89529ad01725ccce2)*[****](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment?utm_source=timhuang.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=what-fevers-fans-and-crm-automations-taught-me-about-gratitude&_bhlid=99dbccb1637b2946c24787d2a9ad4609472c0270)** by Fyodor Dostoevsky**- It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve tackled one of the classics. I‚Äôve attempted to read Crime and Punishment several times in the past, but ended up dropping it early on. It‚Äôs psychologically intense, making it difficult to soak it in all at once. Luckily, this also makes it a great ‚Äúproject book‚Äù where I can squeeze in a couple of chapters here and there during unstructured time.
