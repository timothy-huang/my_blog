Most of us, most of the time, are not thinking about other people.

And likewise, most people, most of the time, are not thinking about us.

It's entirely possible to go days, weeks, or even months without thinking about a particular person, even if you were once close friends.

Then suddenly, you might think, "Oh, I wonder what John is up to?"

Perhaps you'll search them up on Instagram. TikTok. Maybe even LinkedIn. And if you're particularly proactive, you might send a message or even call to check in on how they're doing.

But if you saw no updates, and didn't receive a reply, there's a good chance you probably wouldn't be all that worried. After all, people are living their own lives, and not everyone is chronically online.

That said, it's entirely possible that John has died. Perhaps days, weeks, or even months ago. After all, you were too busy living your life to notice.

And that's the paradox. Most of us want to feel significant. To feel seen by others. But for most of us, there's often very few, if any people who are embedded enough in our lives to truly notice if we were disappear one day.

That's not to say that all of our connections were meaningless. In the moment, they were meaningful, there's no doubt about it. The inside jokes you may have shared. The late night walks. Or the care you showed, when someone really needed it. All those moments were meaningful, and both you and those you connected with will take those moments with you for the rest of your life.

However, over time, and with distance, the daily act of "noticing" goes away. You move on, they move on, and the world moves on.

It's highly likely that we'll all experience this at some point in our lives, particular in "liminal spaces", where we're not directly interacting with a community on a regular basis. But perhaps it's not something we have to fight. Just something we have to acknowledge.

That to be human, is to want to be seen.

And perhaps knowing that, we'll extend a bit more kindness to others in our lives.
