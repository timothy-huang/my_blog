## Hello world! 

It's Tim, again.


Over the years, I've built many personal websites. I've tried so many different tools - from pure HTML/CSS static sites deployed on Github Pages, to heavy duty CMS's like Wordpress, to Jekyll, back to Wordpress, and now -- I'm using Hugo.

I've decided that for my needs (writing quick blog posts, on the fly), I want to prioritize my website's speed and simplicity. I also want to save some money. So - no more hosting service for now. We're going back to good old static sites, backed up with a nice framework that will help me keep my content organized. And most importantly, fast.

For people who aren't interested in that techy mumbo-jumbo, don't worry. I usually write in a pretty conversational tone for normal people :)
