Sunday, 7:22pm
Asakusa, Tokyo, Japan

Hi there!

I‚Äôve been settling into Japan over the last few weeks. A quick recap:

-

**Hiroshima**: Visited the Peace Memorial and Atomic Bomb Dome (and celebrated my birthday‚ÄîI‚Äôm officially 26! üòØ)

-

**Kiso Valley:** Hiked through sections of the Nakasendo, an ancient highway that stretched from Kyoto to Tokyo. üõ£Ô∏è

-

**Matsumoto / Japanese Alps**: Matsumoto is now one of my new favorite cities in Japan! It‚Äôs a mid-sized city known for its pure natural spring water, delicious soba, and easy access to the Japanese Alps. ‚õ∞Ô∏è

-

**Tokyo**: Met up with a couple old friends from study abroad üéâ

# Running out of travel steam

At this point, I‚Äôm pretty tired of bouncing between hostels.

As much as I love exploring, you *can* have too much of a good thing.

In no particular order, I miss:

-

Having a regular exercise routine

-

Waking up in the same bed every day, without being subject to the wakeup schedules / sleeping habits (i.e. snoring) of my hostel mates

-

Hanging out with a consistent friend group

-

Blocking out time to make progress on a long-term project

-

Cooking my own meals

# The original plan

My [original plan](https://timhuang.beehiiv.com/p/starting-a-new-chapter?utm_source=timhuang.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=life-plans-update&_bhlid=7fd791d36e9510a868ee2a184121e034880dbec5&last_resource_guid=Post%3A092a9955-c5b8-42a1-8f69-8171262f6e4a) was to end my time in East Asia with this itinerary:

-

**September**: Japan

-

**October:** Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mainland China

After my East Asia chapter, I planned on going to South Asia:

-

**November:** Nepal, India

-

**December-January:** India, Pakistan

However, I‚Äôm now considering putting a pause on the traveling after October. Putting recent political developments aside (like the Nepal protests), I figure by that point I‚Äôll be too drained to properly immerse myself in the places I‚Äôm visiting.

# So what‚Äôs the new plan?

I‚Äôm still working out the details, but here are few core things I want to focus on this upcoming year:

1.

Continue my language learning journey

1.

Start working on my own project, with the goal of launching it as a product

1.

Stabilize my living situation, pick a place to live for the next year and make a consistent friend group

My thinking has evolved a bit over the last few weeks, but right now, my most likely course of action is to:

1.

Pick up learning **Japanese** again, aim to pass the JLPT N2 (N1 as a stretch goal), before focusing on other languages (e.g. Korean, Mandarin)

1.

Begin design, development, and testing of a new **language learning companion app** idea I‚Äôve been refining‚Äîprimarily to help with reading comprehension.

1.

**Move to Japan** (most likely Tokyo), enroll in a language school for one year, and find a long-term living arrangement

# How I arrived at this decision

Some of you might be surprised by my new plan, others not so much.

This was a hastily written newsletter, and I left out the internal debates that led me here. I may go back and do a proper writeup, but as a teaser, here were some other options I was debating:

-

Returning to the PM career path vs working on my own project

-

Learning Korean vs Chinese vs Japanese

-

Moving back to the US vs staying abroad

I‚Äôve also pivoted quite a bit in my areas of interest (remember when I was talking about the creator economy? üòÖ)

Here are a couple of the guiding questions I‚Äôve been following in order to make decisions over these last few months:

-

What am I naturally more drawn to? What feels energizing vs draining?

-

What will help me grow towards the type of person I want to become?

-

What will I regret more?

And so far, my current plan seems to check the boxes. ‚úÖ

# Closing thoughts

Thanks for following along with my bumpy journey‚Äîif you have any questions, advice, or feedback, I‚Äôd love to hear from you!

Until next time,
Tim
