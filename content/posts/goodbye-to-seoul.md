Hello from the land of gators in Orlando, Florida! üêä

On Friday, I flew out of Seoul and back to the US for a two-week stop to see family and friends.

When I first arrived in Seoul, it was hard to avoid comparing Korea to Japan and Taiwan, given their cultural and geographic similarities. But over time, I noticed‚Äîand grew to love‚Äîmany of the unique quirks of Korean culture:

-

Cafes that never open any earlier than 8am.

-

A widespread iced Americano dependency.

-

Weirdly well-curated playlists, even from your local ajumma.

-

A culture of directness‚Äîespecially from older folks. If they‚Äôre annoyed, you‚Äôll know.

-

‚ÄúHealing fiction‚Äù is a genre. A very popular one.

-

You can buy groceries on a payment plan.

-

Hanok villages sit next to towering skyscrapers.

-

A global outlook, shaped by capitalism, trade, and a distinct national identity.

I thought for a while about how to share what my time in Seoul meant to me. But ultimately, I realized it wasn‚Äôt a thought. It was a feeling.

So instead of my usual journal-style reflections, I‚Äôll keep it simple with a poem I jotted down this morning.

it was another summer of strong feelings
of cicadas, of language learning, of new friendships
of new routines‚Äîand striving, always striving‚Äî
for peace, for contentment

and in the moments where you can‚Äôt help
but be a hundred percent there
repeating after the teacher
laughing at a friend‚Äôs joke
sipping coffee in the morning, mid-conversation
ordering kimbap from ajumma

you live the peace

thank you, seoul
for another chance
to live freely and wholeheartedly
to feel the joy of being
the joy of connection

to bring me closer
to whatever it is
i‚Äôve been searching for
all along

Thanks again for following along üôÇ Those in the Bay‚ÄîI hope I catch some of you while I‚Äôm there.

Until next time!
Tim
