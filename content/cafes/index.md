### A little place

- **Overall:** 3.5/5
- **Best for:** Journaling, reading, light lunch
- **Price:** ¥650 for an espresso tonic
- <a target="_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/r4HtfGQRz55HXyNy9">Location</a>

A little place is a charming hole-in-the-wall tucked into a surprisingly quiet street north of Sensoji temple. The owner is Taiwanese, and all the beans are imported from Taiwan. The coffee is solid, and the second floor is well-lit with a couple of tables. Not quite the vibe for working, but it would be a nice place to relax with a friend after exploring the busy streets of Asakusa.

### February Coffee Roastery

- **Overall:** 4/5
- **Best for:** Morning grab-and-go coffee
- **Price:** ¥550 for the house blend
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RqeeipMeHkeo2ys26">Location</a>

February coffee roastery has some great coffee. You can order some dutch babies for breakfast as well, but seating inside is tight. Best to go as a group of one or two, if you're looking to sit inside. Interior is stylish and cozy.

### KIELO Coffee

- **Overall:** 4/5
- **Best for:** Coffee, chatting, light work
- **Price:** ¥1000 for a single origin latte
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SwhGSKxBCDtogXdf6">Location</a>

Kielo has great coffee. It's cozy and well-lit inside, with a Japanese minimalist aesthetic. The first thing you see is a large rounded oval table in the middle of the room, which is great for pulling out a laptop to do some work on. The staff is friendly, and kept serving me water whenever I ran out (even though I was just working).

### Glitch Coffee and Roasters

- **Overall:** 3.5/5
- **Best for:** Focus on the coffee
- **Price:** ¥1300 for a single origin hand drip coffee
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/TMsvh2fMXJyLNJ1G8">Location</a>

Glitch is famous on the internet among coffee nerds. Apparently they're some of the best coffee in Tokyo. The interior is dark and moody, and the barista counters are stylishly lined with pourover contraptions. You can select from a variety of high end beans, all of which will make your wallet cry. While the coffee was good, I can't say I would go again, owing to the price.

### Walkabout Coffee

- **Overall:** 3/5
- **Best for:** Working
- **Price:** ¥600 for a flat white
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/oMc3zgCWn7shnfGi8">Location</a>

One of the rarer places that serve a flat white. Walkabout coffee has decent coffee, but the interior can feel a bit sterile. Big windows means lots of natural lighting, but it also feels like the first floor lobby of a 5 over 1 apartment building. Kind of like a Blue Bottle, but with less character. At least there's free wifi and ample seating.

### Coffee Wrights Kuramae

- **Overall:** 4/5
- **Best for:** Focused work, journaling, quiet chatting
- **Price:** ¥680 for a hand drip
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XnGb9GFK5Rdz5SRg7">Location</a>

A 2 story shop, where the first floor is dedicating to roasting beans. Coffee is great quality for the price. The second floor is spacious and brightly lit, with ample table seating. Vibes are quiet and calm, great for journaling while sipping on your coffee. Free wifi, but limited outlets.

### Nui

- **Overall:** 3.5/5
- **Best for:** Focused work, chatting
- **Price:** ¥600 for a latte
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/s3FbwWSkJt1DLm6y5">Location</a>

The first floor of an attached hostel. You can eat brunch here while sipping on coffee. The first floor has two levels, and the interior decor has a vaguely ocean-themed aesthetic with weathered wooden flooring, driftwood tables, and a random pulley in the bathroom--making the room visually interesting and great for Instagram.

### Sarutahiko Coffee

- **Overall:** 3/5
- **Best for:** Light working, chatting
- **Price:** ¥550 for a cafe latte
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eVSofXs4rXtbZABi7">Location</a>

Sarutahiko is like a nicer, Japanese version of Starbucks, with branches all throughout Tokyo. Coffee is pretty good. Shibuya branch is noisy because of all the people moving around and chatting, would recommend bringing headphones if trying to work or read. Free wi-fi, but no outlets. Spacious, warm lighting. Not too hard to grab a seat.
