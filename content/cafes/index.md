Keeping track of the cafes I've visited.

## Tokyo

### Yoyogi

- TBD

### Shibuya

**Sarutahiko Coffee** <a target="_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eVSofXs4rXtbZABi7">(Map)</a>

- **Overall:** 7/10
- **Best for:** Light working / chatting
- **Price:** ¥550 for a Cafe Latte

Sarutahiko is like a nicer, Japanese version of Starbucks, with branches all throughout Tokyo. Coffee is pretty good. Shibuya branch is noisy because of all the people moving around and chatting, would recommend bringing headphones if trying to work or read. Free wi-fi, but no outlets. Spacious, warm lighting. Not too hard to grab a seat.
