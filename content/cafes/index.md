Coffee enjoyer, not a coffee specialist.

**Rating scale:**

- 1/5 = Bleh, wouldn't go again
- 2/5 = Mediocre, but okay in a pinch
- 3/5 = Average, go on a normal day

### A little place

- **Overall:** 3.5/5
- **Best for:** Journaling, reading, light lunch
- **Price:** ¥650 for an espresso tonic
- **Last visited:** Sep 2025
- <a target="_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/r4HtfGQRz55HXyNy9">Location</a>

A little place is a charming hole-in-the-wall tucked into a surprisingly quiet street north of Sensoji temple. The owner is Taiwanese, and all the beans are imported from Taiwan. The coffee is solid, and the second floor is well-lit with a couple of tables. Not quite the vibe for working, but it would be a nice place to relax with a friend after exploring the busy streets of Asakusa.

### February Coffee Roastery

- **Overall:** 4/5
- **Best for:** Morning grab-and-go coffee
- **Price:** ¥550 for the house blend
- **Last visited:** Dec 2025
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RqeeipMeHkeo2ys26">Location</a>

February coffee roastery has some great coffee. You can order some dutch babies for breakfast, but space is tight. If you're looking to sit inside, it's best to go as a group of one or two. The interior is retro and cozy.

### KIELO Coffee

- **Overall:** 4/5
- **Best for:** Coffee, chatting, light work
- **Price:** ¥1000 for a single origin latte
- **Last visited:** Sep 2025
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SwhGSKxBCDtogXdf6">Location</a>

Kielo has great coffee. It's cozy and well-lit inside, with a Japanese minimalist aesthetic. The first thing you see is a large oval table in the middle of the room, which is great for pulling out a laptop to do some work on. The staff is friendly and kept serving me water whenever I ran out.

### Glitch Coffee and Roasters

- **Overall:** 3.5/5
- **Best for:** Focus on the coffee
- **Price:** ¥1300 for a single origin hand drip coffee
- **Last visited:** Sep 2025
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/TMsvh2fMXJyLNJ1G8">Location</a>

Glitch is famous on the internet among coffee nerds. Apparently they're some of the best coffee in Tokyo. The interior is dark and moody, and the barista counters are stylishly lined with pourover contraptions. You can select from a variety of high end beans, all of which will make your wallet cry. While the coffee was good, I can't say I would go again, owing to the price.

### Walkabout Coffee

- **Overall:** 3/5
- **Best for:** Working
- **Price:** ¥600 for a flat white
- **Last visited:** Sep 2025
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/oMc3zgCWn7shnfGi8">Location</a>

One of the few places that serves a flat white. Walkabout coffee has decent coffee, but the interior can feel a bit sterile. Big windows means lots of natural lighting, but it also feels like the first floor lobby of a 5 over 1 apartment building. Kind of like a Blue Bottle, but with less character. At least there's free wifi and ample seating.

### Coffee Wrights Kuramae

- **Overall:** 4/5
- **Best for:** Focused work, journaling, quiet chatting
- **Price:** ¥680 for a hand drip
- **Last visited:** Sep 2025
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XnGb9GFK5Rdz5SRg7">Location</a>

A two-story shop, where the first floor is dedicating to roasting beans. Coffee is great quality for the price. The second floor is spacious and brightly lit, with ample table seating. Vibes are quiet and calm, great for journaling while sipping on your coffee. Free wifi, but limited outlets.

### Nui

- **Overall:** 3.5/5
- **Best for:** Focused work, chatting
- **Price:** ¥600 for a latte
- **Last visited:** Sep 2025
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/s3FbwWSkJt1DLm6y5">Location</a>

The first floor of an attached hostel. You can eat brunch here while sipping on coffee. The first floor has two levels, and the interior decor has a vaguely ocean-themed aesthetic with weathered wooden flooring, driftwood tables, and a random pulley in the bathroom---making the room visually interesting and great for Instagram.

### Sarutahiko Coffee

- **Overall:** 3/5
- **Best for:** Light working, chatting
- **Price:** ¥550 for a cafe latte
- **Last visited:** Jan 2026
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eVSofXs4rXtbZABi7">Location</a>

Sarutahiko is like a nicer, Japanese version of Starbucks, with branches all throughout Tokyo. Coffee is pretty good. Shibuya branch is noisy because of all the people moving around and chatting, would recommend bringing headphones if trying to work or read. Free wi-fi, but no outlets. Spacious, warm lighting. Not too hard to grab a seat.

### Masako Jazz & Coffee

- **Overall:** 3.5/5
- **Best for:** Listening to Jazz while contemplating the complexities of the universe
- **Price:** ¥650 for an iced blend
- **Last visited:** Sep 2025
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wgT1NfkLMoRsEttB8">Location</a>

Tucked upstairs from a tiny entrance along the streets of Shimokitazawa, Masako is a place for jazz, not your idle chatter. Every chair is pointed towards one direction: the direction of music. It's a nice place to relax and soak in the jazzy grooves. The coffee is decent too.

### Beasty Coffee

- **Overall:** 4/5
- **Best for:** Working while enjoying some good coffee
- **Price:** ¥700 for a cafe latte
- **Last visited:** Jan 2026
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mgeozgZ6vMxJBwN17">Location</a>

One of the many shops along the trendy Kamiyama street, Beasty Coffee is a cafe where you'll feel comfortable working---there are plentiful outlets, free wifi, and a chill but lively ambience with JR&B playing in the background and a handful of chatty customers. Yes, it's a bit pricier than your average cafe, but a lot cheaper than your average coworking space. Not to mention, the latte is excellent. There's a ¥100 discount if you buy two drinks within the same day.

### YUSUAL

- **Overall:** 3.5/5
- **Best for:** People watching, journaling, reading
- **Price:** ¥650 for a cafe latte
- **Last visited:** Jan 2026
- <a target="\_" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/L6djE54E7FBk6o5w7">Location</a>

Also along Kamiyama street, YUSUAL is on the second floor of a boutique clothing shop that's cream-colored, with accents of light wood. The room is brightly lit by a large window at the front where you can people watch, and people can watch you. The latte art is simple and cute, and the coffee itself is high quality. The calming acoustic music sets the volume at a soft level, so it might get awkward if you're the type to hammer down on your keyboard.
