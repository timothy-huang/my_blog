Hi there! If you landed on this page, you've probably seen something I wrote related to travel, and you're interested in learning how to do it yourself.

Or maybe you're just curious how the hell this guy was able to travel for a year in his mid-20s.

In either case, I've documented the step-by-step process for how I planned for and took my own travel sabbatical. If you've always wanted to explore the world for an extended period of time _without working_, and you don't want to wait 40 years until retirement to do it, hopefully you'll find this useful.

## Step 1: Make sure I actually want to do this

I had always dreamed of going on a 1-year trip to travel around the world, but I had never traveled from country to country before for weeks at a time, not to mention a who year.

I'd also never tried staying in hostels with strangers before, which was a big part of my strategy to stay within my budget for this trip and also to make sure I had an avenue to socialize.

So to see how I would actually like the lifestyle, several months before I officially turned in my 2-weeks notice, I used up all my banked up PTO to go on a 1-month backpacking trip around Europe. After all, I didn't want to leave a perfectly good job to do something that I would end up hating.

On that trip I discovered that I was comfortable with hostel living, and I learned a lot about how to manage my energy levels, stay social, and absorb my surroundings as I moved from place to place. At the end of the trip, I had built up the confidence and the desire to continue traveling.

## Step 2: Make sure I had the savings to support it
