In either case, I&rsquo;ve documented the step-by-step process for how I planned for and took my own travel sabbatical.

<h2 id="step-1-make-sure-i-actually-want-to-do-this">Step 1: Make sure I actually want to do this</h2>
<p>I had always dreamed of going on a 1-year trip to travel around the world, but I had never traveled from country to country before for weeks at a time, not to mention a who year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also never tried staying in hostels with strangers before, which was a big part of my strategy to stay within my budget for this trip and also to make sure I had an avenue to socialize.</p>
<p>So to see how I would actually like the lifestyle, several months before I officially turned in my 2-weeks notice, I used up all my banked up PTO to go on a 1-month backpacking trip around Europe. After all, I didn&rsquo;t want to leave a perfectly good job to do something that I would end up hating.</p>
<p>On that trip I discovered that I was comfortable with hostel living, and I learned a lot about how to manage my energy levels, stay social, and absorb my surroundings as I moved from place to place. At the end of the trip, I had built up the confidence and the desire to continue traveling.</p>
