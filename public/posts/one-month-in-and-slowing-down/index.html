Hello friends! I meant to write this last Sunday, but I was 30 meters underwater exploring a sunken WWII ship. Worth it.
Now that I‚Äôm over a month in to my travels, I‚Äôve started taking things a bit slower. I‚Äôve been cutting down my activities to 1-2 things per location, even when the internet says these are the 6 things you MUST see in [location]." />

<p>Hello friends! I meant to write this last Sunday, but I was 30 meters underwater exploring a sunken WWII ship. Worth it.</p>
<p>Now that I‚Äôm over a month in to my travels, I‚Äôve started taking things a bit slower. I‚Äôve been cutting down my activities to 1-2 things per location, even when the internet says these are the 6 things you MUST see in [location].</p>
<h1 id="highlights">Highlights</h1>
<h2 id="left-for-the-philippines">Left for the Philippines!</h2>
<p>I left Indonesia for the Philippines and landed in Manila about a week ago.</p>
<p>One of my first stops was <strong>Fully Booked</strong>‚Äîwhere I picked up a couple of books because I was getting sick of reading on my phone.</p>
<p>Reading in a cafe</p>
<p>I do wish I spent more time in Manila. People are pretty harsh on the city on Reddit (including Filipinos), but I found the area I was staying in (Makati) to be quite pleasant.</p>
<h2 id="catching-the-sunsets">Catching the sunsets</h2>
<p>The Philippines has so much natural beauty. If you‚Äôre looking for the ultimate island experience, don‚Äôt sleep on visiting the Philippines. Not to mention, everyone I‚Äôve met has been friendly, polite (they call you ‚Äúsir‚Äù üôÇ ), and speak English very well, making it easy to communicate.</p>

<h2 id="getting-my-advanced-open-water-diving-certification">Getting my Advanced Open Water Diving certification</h2>
<p>I really didn‚Äôt expect this one.</p>
<p>I only got my Open Water Diving certification 2 weeks ago in Bali, which lets me dive up to a depth of 18m. I was pretty happy with that, and I planned on getting more practice in before trying anything crazy.</p>
<p>But then I made a friend in Coron who showed me pictures of her diving some shipwrecks which were beyond the 18m limit. The FOMO was too much, and I decided to send it and signed up for my Advanced Open Water course the next day.</p>
<p>I ended up diving 4 different Japanese shipwrecks from WW2. For some, the only way you can see inside is with a flashlight.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-from-one-month-in">Reflections from one month in</h1>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to believe it‚Äôs already been one month since I quit my job and started my travels.</p>
<p>It feels like a lot has happened, but it also flew by. Some recent reflections:</p>
<h2 id="1-what-moments-make-me-feel-most-alive">1. What moments make me feel most alive?</h2>
<p>I feel the most alive when I‚Äôm actively connecting with someone‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a new friend I made at the hostel, taking a cooking class with my homestay host, or throwing a shaka (ü§ô) with my diving instructor when we see something cool.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm naturally introverted, and I enjoy time by myself to read, write, and reflect on life. At the same time, I‚Äôve realized the most special moments are usually the ones I share with others. I guess my life will be a balancing act of pushing myself to connect with people while making space to decompress on my own.</p>
<h2 id="2-what-am-i-starting-to-see-differentlyabout-myself-or-the-world">2. What am I starting to see differently‚Äîabout myself or the world?</h2>
<p>On nearly a daily basis, I‚Äôve noticed how the big stuff‚Äîgeopolitics, race, class, identity‚Äîinfluences the small stuff, like how people live, work, and interact day to day.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs humbling to recognize how much privilege I grew up with as an Asian-American in the San Francisco Bay Area:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I have the means to travel</strong> - with shockingly disproportional purchasing power due to the relatively high income in the Bay Area. Not to mention, the ease of obtaining a visa due to my American passport.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I have the benefit of being (conversationally) fluent in multiple cultures and languages</strong>- which allows me to connect or blend in as needed with people from different parts of the world. Speaking English with an American accent allows me to easily enter conversations with people from Anglo and European countries. And on more than one occasion, I‚Äôve discovered my common language with someone is Chinese, rather than English.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I am generally treated with respect and have few concerns about safety</strong> - Apart from the frequent misidentification of my ethnicity (harmless), I haven‚Äôt had any issues with racist comments or being treated disrespectfully while traveling. I also feel safe walking around on my own (even at night), and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with pickpocketing or harassment. I recognize this isn‚Äôt necessarily the case for people of all ethnicities, nationality, gender, religions, and sexualities.</p>
<p>From a societal perspective, I‚Äôm starting to recognize how colonization, differences in political systems, and globalization have impacted the different places I‚Äôve visited. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll expand on the depth of my understanding as I visit more countries and read more history, but a couple observations that have stood out so far:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Colonization was not a part of the conversation in Europe</strong>- When I visited Europe last year, I could barely tell there was a history of colonization. For example, if it hadn‚Äôt been the curious inclusion of Indonesian food in Amsterdam (a very welcome addition to the diversity of cuisine there), I could have gone without even knowing which countries it colonized. Whether through memorials, museums, or monuments, the national conscience of each country I visited was much more focused on highlighting the impact and victims of World War 2, rather than reflecting on the impact of the country‚Äôs own colonial history.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Colonization in Asia had mixed impact</strong>- On the plus side, colonization left remnants of investments in infrastructure and the creation of national identities that unified diverse people (although it begs the question, at what cost?). At the same time, it extracted natural resources away from the local economy, exacerbated class divides between the educated elite and the masses, and of course there were atrocities committed through forced labor and violent suppression.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lingering colonial attitudes from some travelers</strong>- I‚Äôve been in conversations where some (emphasis on SOME) people have casually dropped how ‚Äúexotic‚Äù they feel Asia is, made snarky comments about being in a third world country, or perhaps worst of all ‚Äî expressed interest in sex tourism. While it may not be intentionally racist, these comments seem to reinforce a sense of superiority or distance from locals as ‚Äúothers‚Äù. That said, I think generally the locals have thick skin and don‚Äôt worry too much about these comments. Also, most people I meet have been respectful and appreciative of the culture / countries they‚Äôve visited. I think the more well-traveled people the more these attitudes start melting away.</p>
<h2 id="3-what-do-i-want-to-carry-forward-into-the-next-month">3. What do I want to carry forward into the next month?</h2>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I want to continue looking at the world with open eyes. I want to better understand how people from different backgrounds view the world, and what the impact that history, politics, and culture have had on nations over time.</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I want to dig into learning some skills more deeply - whether that‚Äôs writing, video editing, AI tools &amp; automations, or a new language.</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I want to develop more confidence in myself and my voice. I want to break my habit of being a people pleaser constantly softening my opinions with qualifiers, and to not be afraid to disagree or to say no.</p>
<p>On that second point, I miss having a ‚Äúthing‚Äù that I‚Äôm super passionate about and can identify with. When I was younger, I strongly identified with being a ‚Äúgamer.‚Äù I recently came to the realization that since college, I haven‚Äôt really had a strong activity-based identity. Instead, I identified as a ‚Äústudent‚Äù or a ‚Äúproduct manager.‚Äù Hopefully I find a hobby that I enjoy enough so this changes in the future ü§û</p>
<h1 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h1>
<p>Coming up next week: More time in the Philippines‚ÄîI‚Äôll be spending a week in Siargao, giving surfing an honest go.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs all for now! Stay tuned for more updates üôÇ</p>

The setting takes place in a cafe where people can time travel, but with certain limitations: they can only travel for as long as their coffee is still warm. It‚Äôs a unique setting and twist on the concept, but there‚Äôs not much complexity to the plot or the characters. I enjoyed it nevertheless üôÇ</p>

After reading his book, I still think he‚Äôs a bit too intense for me, but I do feel more motivated to tackle hard things (and maybe run an ultramarathon one day).</p>
