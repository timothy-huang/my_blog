  <section><p>Hello friends!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been back from my month-long backpacking trip in Europe for about two weeks now, and I&rsquo;m getting back in the groove of adding shareholder value.</p>
<p>One thing that I’m reflecting on is that leading up to the trip, I experienced a renewed sense of energy.</p>
<p>For most of 2024, I felt like time was just passing by. It wasn’t that I was too busy. I had a pretty decent work-life balance, and I had plenty of time outside of work to dedicate to my hobbies or chores.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t feel particularly motivated to make the most of that time. I would scroll and scroll on Reddit or Youtube and suddenly, it would be time to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>It’s not that I was doing <em>nothing</em>. To the contrary, I made some of the most epic memories hanging out with friends and traveling throughout the US in 2024. But those moments were short and punctuated. And soon, I returned to my boring, weekday routine.</p>
<p>Everything changed once I had made the decision to go to Europe for an entire month. Suddenly, it felt like I was more engaged with my day-to-day life. Because I knew my big trip was coming up, I felt a stronger sense of urgency to make the most of my time, even during the weekdays, leading up to the trip.</p>
<p>I was actively try to hang out with more friends, reading books to learn new skills, and desperately onboarding teammates who would be looking over my projects while I was out.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and I’m trying to hold on to that feeling.</p>
<p>Now, I have a new big, ambitious goal that’s bringing back that same sense of urgency again. Taking a step away from work for a while gave me the clarity I needed to convince myself “hey, this is what I want to do next, and this is when I want to do it.” This pattern of changing my environment to gain clarity is something I’ve done roughly every 2 years or so, like clockwork.</p>
<p>If you’re stuck in a routine that feels stagnant, I highly encourage planning a big trip. It’ll give you something to look forward to, introduce some urgency to your day-to-day, and once you’re there, you’ll have space to think about what you want to do next.</p>
<p>That’s what worked for me, anyways.</p>
<p>In other news…</p>
<h2 id="-i-started-a-new-blog">🚀 I started a new blog!</h2>
<p>You can check it out at <a href="timhuang.co">timhuang.co</a> (link updated in Oct 2025).</p>
<p>I’m still trying to figure out how I’ll differentiate content between my blog and newsletter. I’m thinking that I’ll probably save most of my deep dive-type content for the blog, and use the newsletter for semi-weekly life updates / reflections.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, I’ll compile any recent posts into my newsletter, so you won’t be missing out on anything 🙂</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>
<p>Tim</p>
